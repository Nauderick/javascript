        /*JavaScript primitive data types: String, Number, Boolean, undefined, Null, and Symbol.*/

        //Numbers
        /*
        Integers: Integer (negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...

        Float-point numbers: Decimal number 
        Example: ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ...
        */

        //Strings
        //A collection of one or more characters between two single quotes, double quotes, or backticks. Examples:
        /*
        'a'
        'Asabeneh'
        "Asabeneh"
        'Finland'
        'JavaScript is a beautiful programming language'
        'I love teaching'
        'I hope you are enjoying the first day'
        `We can also create a string using a backtick`
        'A string could be just as small as one character or as big as many pages'
        'Any data type under a single quote, double quote or backtick is a string'
        */

        //Booleans
        //A boolean value is either True or False. Any comparisons returns a boolean value, which is either true or false. Example:
        true // if the light is on, the value is true
        false // if the light is off, the value is false

        //Undefined
        //In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In addition to that, if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined. Example:
        let firstName
        console.log(firstName) // undefined, because it is not assigned to a value yet.

        //Null
        //Null in JavaScript means an empty value.
        let emptyValue = null

        //Checking Data Types
        //To check the data type of a certain variable, we use the typeof operator. See the following example.
        console.log(typeof 'Asabeneh') // string
        console.log(typeof 5) // number
        console.log(typeof true) // boolean
        console.log(typeof null) // object type
        console.log(typeof undefined) // undefined
